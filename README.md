# MyOnTheMap
This a Udacity project on iOS Networking with Swift

## Description

OnTheMap is an iOS application that uses Udacity student profiles to load both a map with pins and annotations and a table with cells containing students' locations and names, respectively. A user can add to both the map and the table to post their location and favorite study tools.

## User Interface

The application begins with a login screen that requires Udacity credentials to login. After you successfully login to OnTheMap, you will be able to view a map containing pins of every student in the Udacity Nanodegree Program containing information on their location and their favorite study tool in the form of a redirectable URL. 

You can view the students through either a map or a table. 

If you want to add your location and favorite study tool to the map, you can tap on the top barButtonItem that's shaped like a pin. After tapping the pin barButtonItem, a view will slide upward and ask you your current location. After you enter the location, tap the "On The Map" button and the view will show a map zooming into your current location, prompting you with another question. 
The next question is "Enter a website", which will be the website of your favorite study tool. After you finish that, you can tap submit and your location will be seen by other Udacity students.
